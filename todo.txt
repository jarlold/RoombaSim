To Do:
- Distancing selection for niche optimizations
- Better "loading screen" while roombas are evolving.
- Stop giving roombas their current positions
- Maybe try adjusting some other metrics
- Test bigger neural networks
- Test a larger number of niches for a smaller amount of time
- Crossover 
- Saving results
- "Human Readable" metrics (amt collided to wall, amt dust eaten)

- Cut population in half, fill remaining half with descendants of the originals
  Since we return to the old population if we don't improve no need to keep both
  So cut population in half, take top half and create population of same size
  with mutations

- Fix UI for hovering on roombas, which is currently pretty useless

- Why always a score of ~ -393 ???
